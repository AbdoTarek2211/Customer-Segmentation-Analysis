# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Analysis

> Advanced machine learning approach to customer segmentation using multiple clustering algorithms

## 📊 Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive customer segmentation solution using the Mall Customer dataset. Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on K-Means clustering, this analysis compares multiple algorithms to find the optimal customer groupings for targeted marketing strategies.

## 🎯 Key Results

- **🏆 Best Performance**: DBSCAN achieved **0.5499 silhouette score** (significantly above industry standard of 0.35-0.45)
- **📈 Superior Metrics**: Davies-Bouldin score of 0.5948 indicating excellent cluster separation
- **🎯 4 Distinct Segments**: Clear, actionable customer profiles identified
- **🔍 79 Edge Cases**: Customers between segments identified for special attention

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Algorithms Compared
- **K-Means Clustering**: Traditional centroid-based approach
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Probabilistic clustering with uncertainty quantification
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering (winner - best performance)

### Features Used
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

### Data Preprocessing
- Comprehensive scaling comparison (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler, PowerTransformer)
- Statistical analysis and correlation assessment
- Missing value analysis and feature distribution study

## 📈 Business Segments Identified

| Segment | Size | Profile | Age | Income | Spending | Strategy |
|---------|------|---------|-----|---------|----------|----------|
| **0** | 14 customers (7%) | Young Big Spenders | 23.7 | $23.9k | 76.6 | Limited-time offers, trendy products |
| **1** | 48 customers (24%) | Mature Conservative | 54.5 | $54.1k | 49.1 | Value proposition, quality emphasis |
| **2** | 29 customers (14.5%) | Young Professionals | 24.4 | $54.5k | 50.2 | Balanced approach, seasonal promotions |
| **3** | 30 customers (15%) | Premium Customers | 32.6 | $80.6k | 82.8 | Premium products, loyalty programs |
